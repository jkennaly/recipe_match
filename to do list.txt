refactoring: 
	find out how ingredient amounts are currently being converted (line 322-340ish)
	use the for loop to put ingredient stuff directly in ingred_dict (line 295)
	add library for measurement conversion

features:
	allow user to convert how many servings they want
	forms to "upload" recipes
	database to store recipes
	html interface and persistent selection memory
	list of recipes when grocery list is displayed

bugs: 
	when it says recipe object, make sure to return recipe.name instead of recipe
